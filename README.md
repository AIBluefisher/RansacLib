# RansacLib

Header-only implementation of RANSAC and its variants.

More details coming soon ...

## Testing
To test the implementation, we provide a simple example, namely 2D line fitting. 
In order to build the example, ```CMake``` and ```Eigen 3.3.X``` is required.
* Create a build directory: ```mkdir build```.
* Build the example: ```cd build```, ```cmake ..```, ```make```
* You can run the executable via ```./example/line_estimation```
